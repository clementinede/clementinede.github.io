    <strong>John Lloyd Waddy</strong> <em>(1916–1987)</em> was a senior officer and aviator in the Royal Australian Air Force, who later served as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly and Minister of the Crown. As a fighter pilot during World War II, he shot down fifteen enemy aircraft in the Desert War, becoming one of Australia's top-scoring aces and earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. He went on to command No. 80 Squadron in the South West Pacific, where he was awarded the US Air Medal. He was also one of eight senior pilots who took part in the "Morotai Mutiny" of April 1945. He led the Air Force Reserve as a group captain in the early 1950s. Active in business and in veterans' groups, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1955. As the Liberal Member for Kirribilli from 1962 to 1976, he held cabinet posts in the New South Wales Parliament, including Minister for Child Welfare and Social Welfare (later Youth and Community Services), Minister for Health, and Minister for Police and Services.

    Featured articles are considered to be the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being listed here, articles are reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style according to our featured article criteria. There are 4,624 featured articles out of 4,980,385 articles on the English Wikipedia (~0.1% are featured). Thus, about one in 1,070 articles is listed here. Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at featured article review.<br />
<blockquote>On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon (This star symbolizes the featured content on Wikipedia.) on the top right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is featured. Additionally, if the current article is featured in another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the Languages list in the sidebar (a user preference allows toggling this on/off under Gadgets > Appearance).</blockquote>
